## Why was this project undertaken?

The project aims to simplify the process of generating a power curve for windmills by letting the user download the appropriate data in the form of an **easy-to-understand** Excel workbook. Previously the "Excel" file was being generated manually, thereby wasting a lot of time of the user. Now, the "Excel" files can be downloaded automatically by employing an easy to use **User Interface**.
