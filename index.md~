##Features of the app

*  Enables the user to download MERRA-2 and ERA data.
*  MERRA-2 data is downloaded from the [NASA website]().
*  ERA data is downloaded from the [ECMWF public datasets](http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/).
*  The user can enter his/her desired windmill coordinates.
*  Can also enter the time period for which the data needs to be downloaded.
*  Can select any/all parameters as desired.
*  The data that is downloaded is stored in a database, so similar requests in the future are met with faster.
*  The data is computed upon to create an *Excel Workbook* for user's convenience.
*  After download, the respective excel sheet is deleted from the database to save server memory.

##Notes of Caution

*  If a particular 'node'(`lat_lon`) folder is not present, it is dynamically created along with its `Final` folder. The `Final` folder is the one where all the final *excel* workbooks reside just before being downloaded. So, in the *latitude* and *longitude* textboxes present in the interface, **DONOT** enter incorrect values. This is because their corresponding 'incorrect node and Final folders' are created.

*  Currently, no progress bar is shown when the user submits a *request* by clicking on the *SUBMIT* button. The user should maintain patience until the *alert* box appears, informing the user that the file is ready yo be downloaded.

*  After the user clicks on the *ok* button in the *alert* box, the file download starts. After the file is downloaded into the user's system, the corresponding excel file in the *server* is deleted. This file is regenerated if the user submits a similar request in the future.
